[A RESTful web service including the parameters HotelID and ArrivalDate.
The web service GET request imports the file (hotelsrates.json), filters the list
by means of the parameters and returns a filtered list.]

This sample application is for uploading json file on the server and read the json file to get the rate detail for the given hotel id and arrival date.

Instruction to run the application

Note: This is the basic functionality with few validations and more there are various use case which needs to be implemented to make it better solution.
